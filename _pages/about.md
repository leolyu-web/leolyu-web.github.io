👋 **Hi there! I am Junlin (Leo) Lyu.**

I am a Graduate Researcher and Master's student at Columbia University in the city of New York, where I work in the [Creative Machines Lab](https://www.creativemachineslab.com) under the supervision of [Prof. Hod Lipson](https://www.hodlipson.com).

## 🤖 Research Interests

My research revolves around **robotics** and **machine learning** with key interests in:

* Humanoid Robot (Face Robot, Robot Arm)
* Robot Learning (Imitation Learning)
* Self-supervised Learning and Self-modeling robots

## 🌟 Research and Highlights

## Design and Modeling of a 3-RRR Parallel Ankle Rehabilitation Robot 
![Rehab Robot](/images/RRR_ankles/ankle_gif.gif){: .align-right width="350px"}

I developed a wearable ankle rehabilitation robot using a 3-RRR spherical parallel mechanism. Complete the engineering pipeline from mechanical design in SolidWorks, 3D-printed prototyping, Lagrangian dynamics modeling, to MATLAB simulation of compliance-modulated PID control.
